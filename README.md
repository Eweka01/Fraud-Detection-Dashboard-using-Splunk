# Fraud Detection Dashboard using Splunk

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of fraudulent transactions using **Splunk Enterprise**. The goal is to gain hands-on experience in data analysis, explore trends, and develop a comprehensive fraud detection dashboard. By visualizing this data, the project aims to uncover fraud patterns and insights in a cybersecurity context.

### Objectives:
- Perform data analysis on a structured dataset using Splunk.
- Build a dashboard to visualize key metrics related to fraud detection.
- Develop skills in creating visualizations, interpreting cyber data, and uncovering trends.
- Gain proficiency with Splunk’s search and reporting features for data analysis.

## Steps Followed

### 1. **Install and Set Up Splunk**
   - **Download:** Downloaded the 60-day free trial version of Splunk Enterprise from the [Splunk website](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html).
   - **Installation:** Followed the instructions to install Splunk on the local system.
   - **Initial Setup:** Configured Splunk, created an account, and ensured that Splunk was ready for data ingestion.

### 2. **Data Preparation and Import**
   - **Dataset Used:** The provided dataset `fraud_dectection.csv` was imported into Splunk.
   - **Data Upload Process:**
     - Imported the data by using the "Add Data" feature in Splunk.
     - During the source type configuration, set the timestamp to "Current Time" for consistency.
     - Explored the data using the "Interesting Fields" section to get an overview of key data fields like `category`, `fraudulent`, `age`, `merchant`, `gender`, and `step`.

### 3. **Creating the Dashboard in Splunk**
   The dashboard was created by running several queries and visualizing important fraud-related metrics. Each query was saved to the dashboard.

   #### Search Queries and Descriptions:

   - **Count by Category, Fraudulent transactions, Age, and Merchant:**
     This query calculates the number of transactions grouped by category, fraud status, age, and merchant.
     ```splunk
     sourcetype="fraud_dectection.csv" | stats count by category, fraudulent, age, merchant
     ```

   - **Fraud Detected by Age, Category, Step (Month), and Gender:**
     This query identifies fraudulent activities by age, category, step (month), and gender.
     ```splunk
     sourcetype="fraud_dectection.csv" fraud="1" | stats count by age, category, step, gender
     ```

   - **Which Gender Performed the Most Fraudulent Activities and in What Category:**
     This query finds which gender was responsible for the most fraud in each category.
     ```splunk
     sourcetype="fraud_dectection.csv" fraud="1" | stats count by gender, category
     ```

   - **Which Age Group Performed the Most Fraudulent Activities and to What Merchant:**
     This query determines the age group that performed the most fraud, grouped by the merchant.
     ```splunk
     sourcetype="fraud_dectection.csv" fraud="1" | stats count by age, merchant
     ```

   - **Fraud Detected Over Time by Month:**
     This query visualizes fraud detection over time by analyzing data based on the `step` field, which represents months.
     ```splunk
     sourcetype="fraud_dectection.csv" fraud="1" | timechart count by step
     ```

   #### Steps for Building the Dashboard:
   - After running each query, I saved the results to a new dashboard titled "Fraud Detection Dashboard."
   - I added various visual elements like bar charts and tables for each key query.
   - Adjusted the layout and design for clarity and easy interpretation of the data.

### 4. **Exporting the Dashboard**
   - After completing the dashboard, I exported it as a **PDF** for submission.
   - The exported dashboard includes charts and tables that visualize the key fraud metrics discussed above.

## Key Learning Outcomes

- **Data Analysis:** Learned how to use Splunk’s search and reporting features to analyze structured datasets.
- **Data Visualization:** Developed skills in visualizing data using Splunk’s dashboard tools, enabling the identification of patterns and trends in fraud data.
- **Cybersecurity:** Understood how cyber data can be analyzed to detect fraudulent transactions, which is crucial in cybersecurity.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Acquired the ability to create comprehensive dashboards that can be used to present complex data in an easy-to-understand manner.

## Tools Used

- **Splunk Enterprise (60-day trial version):** For data ingestion, analysis, and visualization.
- **Prepared Dataset:** A structured dataset of fraudulent transactions (`fraud_dectection.csv`).
- **Splunk’s Search Processing Language (SPL):** For writing search queries and visualizing data.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how data analysis and visualization can play a key role in fraud detection. By analyzing the `fraud_dectection.csv` dataset, I was able to uncover trends and insights related to fraudulent transactions. The dashboard created in Splunk serves as an effective tool for understanding the patterns in fraud, which can be leveraged for cybersecurity and fraud prevention efforts.
